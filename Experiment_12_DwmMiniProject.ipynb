I face it all the time, joyfully. But I have extra features which make me further discriminating against others . This is important that in modern societies, we have not cultured our children to culture their identity. So the next dimension of intelligence is called as ahankara .\\', \\' We have not cultured our children right froman early age that your identity should be universal . This is something in India traditionally. Before you start education for a child, there is something called Vidyarambham, where the first chant that they must do is that my identificationis with the entire cosmos .\\', \" Sadhguru: These people, looking at their actions, you may be sitting here — I know I\\'m getting into a minefield. But you must understand this. They believe they\\'re doing the greatest thing that a human being can do. They’re working for God. There can be no better employer. Not Google– God .\", \" These are wonderful guys. These are guys who are willing to die for what they believe in. But they\\'ve been screwed up by the scriptures. they made this thing that girls should not go to school and many other things. So there’s ahankara. This identity is what wills the intellect. If you hold the right identity, from an early vantageage if it\\'s brought into us that your identity is with the entire cosmos– because nothing happens here without everything\\'s involvement in you.\", \\' There is another dimension of intelligence within you, which can make you come to an experience of this . The next dimension is called manas, which means a huge silo of memory . There are eight types of memory in this . One is called sanchita.. there is a bank of memory, which determines the very shape of the shape .\\', \" Inarticulate memory, that there is a memory that you can never articulate but it\\'s finding expression . When you see a chair, you know this is where you should sit, not there . The next dimension of intelligence is called as chitta, an intelligence without an iota of memory in it, unsullied by memory .\", \\' We have misunderstood the power of ignorance, the yogic system . We identify with our ignorance, never with our knowledge. This is something we must do in a technology company. That is where the new terrain is, not in your knowledge, not your knowledge. So chitta is unsullied by memory. It’s just pure intelligence.\\', \" Sadhguru: Identifying with the cosmos is just another thought. As a thought, it doesn’t do much. It makes people a little airy brained and they’ll start acting funny. You become New Agey. You know, I love the cosmos. It’s very easy to love the universe because it\\'s not here with you. If you’ve got to love somebody next to you, there\\'s lots of problems .\", \" You see a dog peeing all over the place not because he has some urinary problems, but it’s a kingdom, he says . Every human being is also doing the same thing. wanting to set up boundaries, is so deep. You want to be something more. If that something more happens, you want to do something more, it\\'s possible. Yes, if that happens for the entire universe, it is possible.\", \\' There is only one thing about you which needs to be preserved: your physicality . This body must be preserved, because if you break it, you can’t fix it . Another dimension always wants to build walls. You build a wall. You feel safe. You want to expand it. After two days, you feel you understand the walls of self-preservation are also self-imprisonment .\\', \\' Sadhguru: You must have a pulverizer, because shredder means they’ll go again, pick it up, and fix it . Jonathan Berent: Can’t you transform some of those things that have been difficult and use that energy, use your energy to do something for good?\\', \\' Sadhguru: The experience of life, whatever happens to you, you can either make it into your wound or into wisdom. You can either become wise or you can become a solution. If you become wise, you will become a problem. It’s a choice we have. o the choice is just this.\\', \\' If I drink it and include it into the boundaries of my sensation, this becomes me, isn’t it? Right now this is not me. But if you drink it, it becomes you. not you. If it happened to you, suppose– it should have happened to many of you– there was a moment in your life when you felt so joyful .\\', \\' If you chop off your right leg, the leg is gone, but still the sensory leg may remain intact for a period of time . This means sensory body has a structure of its own . If your energies become very vibrant and exuberant within you, your sensory body expands . Now you’ll become a part of me and my experience .\\', \\' Sadhguru: What we will do is with your eyes closed, just rub this briskly like this for two minutes, let me say, one minute — briskly OK, hold your thumbs three to four inches away from each other with your hands . You rub it, and suddenly something happening between these two hands, simply because of vigorous movement the sensory body has expanded. You can feel something happening right here.\\', \\' Yoga means union. Union does not mean you cause the union. You are allowed yourself to experience it. That means the walls of self-preservation have loosened up a little bit, that’s all . If it happens mentally, it gets labeled as greed and ambition and conquest . If you can sit here with your life at itspeak of exuberance, y\\', \\' Sadhguru: Being a skeptic means you don’t believe anything unless it truly makes sense to you . Most people are just downright suspicious, but they think they’re skeptics . This comes from a certain fear within you that everything around you can be wrong . Suspicion means you made a conclusion about something that you do not know .\\', \\' Sadhguru: Skeptic means whatever I do not know, I do. I don’t assume things in my life. I think everybody should come to this much sense and straightness in our life . If you’re a believer, we have to debrief you. If you are a skeptic, you are an ideal candidate for the job .\\', \\' Sadhguru: Your intellect needs data to function– yes, or no? Without data, your intellect is useless. It needs data. That’s why you guys are in the business. Everybody knows everything in the universe. Because they googled it up. Because intellect feels stupid without data.\\', \\' You can’t roll your eyeballs inward and . scan yourself . You can hear this. You can feel this. If an ant crawls upon your hand, you can feel it. You cannot feel it . Because the sense organs are instruments of .survival. They come on when you’re born . Whatever is needed for survival for any biological creature, it turns on at the time of birth because it’s needed . Otherwise you wouldn’ve survived .\\', \\' Anything that you know, from reading to writing, from using a computer or singing a song or whatever, you know these things with certain striving . I want you to remember when you were three, four years of age, that damn A, how complicated it was, as if it were not enough, there were two versions of it, which freaked the hell out of you . Today you can write with your eyes closed. Still, there are others in the world who did not strive in that direction . Without striving, anything beyond survival would not enter your life .\\', \" Sadhguru: All these identities of religion, race, caste, creed, nationality is they’re trying to set their own bondage . Jonathan Berent: What humanity is suffering and confused about is not their bondage. They\\'re suffering their freedom. What do you do with that?\", \\' Jonathan Berent: People will stand there and tears will come to them. It really amazes me. People get identified with a symbol, with a word, with just about anything, all right? So you are trying to create some artificial.lylylyboundary of your own. Once you create this boundary and you have . another boundary, I have my boundary, when they meet, we clash.\\', \\' Sadhguru: A democratic society means tomorrow you may become the president of this country or a prime minister of another country . A politician did not drop from the sky, he is not some other creature. He is just like you and me. He stuck his neck out, which you and us are not willing to do .\\', \\' Peace conferences must have an atmosphere where politicians let their hair down and talk like human beings . Without them, what are you going to change? Peace conferences, if it’s just an entertainment, you can gather your friends and have a peace conference. But if you want peace on the planet, the most important politicians in this world must be there. Only then there is a possibility of peace, he says .\\', \\' I said, if you cannot make your mind peaceful, how the hell are you going to make the world peaceful? I asked, can all of you or any of you put your hand on your heart and say you are genuinely peaceful in your life? They were straight enough. They said, no, we are not peaceful. He said, \"Hello? Whatever the issues, we’ll sit down and handle it, right? Because the world is just a larger manifestation of the nonsense in our heads\"\\', \\' Sadhguru: How do we tell our children that their identity is more when our own thinking is so limited? How do I pass something like that to a child when I am not capable of doing that myself? He says: Whatever you tell your children, your children don’t listen to you. They pick up things from the way you are behaving .\\', \" When they have a child, these parents, they did everything possible to the child. They thought this is their life, not just changing diapers, but they taught they\\'re living for this person. As this person becomes bigger and in their over-concern about how this child should be, trying to teach him the best things in the universe, which is not true in their lives . Slowly you will see by the time he becomes a teenager, he avoids them.\", \" Sadhguru: When you\\'re born, just everybody around you is trying to teach you something that did not work in their life. It’s not going to work. You don’t have to say a word. I will tell you– is it OK if I can share something? Jonathan Berent: I brought up my girl alone. At the age of seven, she lost her mother .\", \\' By the time she was 18 months, she was speaking three languages fluently . At the age of 13, something she was disturbed at school, she came back home . And one day she said, you’re teaching everybody so many things. Never look up to anybody. That’s how you have to do with life. Suddenly you will see life just the way it is. ing.\\', \" You divided the universe in a million different ways, and then you’re trying to fix it. It’s not going to work. The instrument which broke the world into pieces is your intellect. With that, you\\'re trying to . fix everything. It\\'s not going . to work . Now, these kind of things are happening because we\\'re using our intellect to fix the problem. You just live that way . Whichever way you live, your children will grasp it, and they’ll make a sense out of that in their own way .\", \\' Sadhguru: In this existence, in this cosmos, we are not even a speck of dust. That small we are. But still, creation has given as an individuality as an individual nature that we can experience these things. But countless number of people who lived on this planet before you and me came came.\\', \\' If you get it from me today, you can transform your life, that really everything is a part of you, and you are part of everything, not as a thought, but experientially . It is the filth which has become the flower, the beauty of this existence .\\', \\' It is just that in our mind and with our intellect, we are breaking everything. This breaking is only a psychological reality. This is not existentially true. For you nose, filth doesn’t feel goo.d But if you were a pig, you would like the filth. Nothing wrong with that. It’s the same thing or no? Hello?\\', \\' The weather is not like this in southern India. It’s hot, summer sun. I made them sit there in hot sun. Close by, there were about five rain trees, three of them really large ones. I would love to be under those trees. But I went on talking, stretching the talk, stretching talk, telling them stories . Then I said, come, and I took them under the tree. Ah! Ah! Suddenly, you know what is a tree.\\', \" I made them sit down there and read. It’s a certain spiritual process that I set up, a process for them where I told them, what you exhale, trees are inhaling . Once they experienced it, now you can’t . stop them from planting trees. They planted over 28 million trees. And you can\\'t stop them.\", \" Robert Frost is a great American poet, says John Sutter . Sutter says he didn\\'t let his English teacher teach him poems by Robert Frost . He says if you call a tree a wood, it\\'s a commodity. This water, this Earth is a commodity, he says .\", \\' The air that you breathe, the water that you drink, the soil that you walk upon, the trees that you sit under, the people that you see, these are not commodities. This is life, isn’t it? Sadhguru: Everything is one, but everything is separate at the same time. That’s why I can sit here and talk to you .\\', \\' Sadhguru: There are two levels of reality: psychological reality and existential reality . Existential reality is not your making. Psychological reality is entirely your making, but a large part of it is unconsciously made, so you believe it is real . Whatever is true in your psychological reality may have some social relevance but has no existential relevance .\\', \" If you want to know life, you have to step out of this bubble called psychological reality and step into existential reality . This is not some empty talk. This has happened to millions of people. If you\\'re willing to dedicate 28 to 30 hours of focused time, we will give you tools with which you can make this happen for yourself .\", \" Only by word of mouth millions of people came. Obviously it must have worked for them to bring their family and friends . And now I\\'m not promising any miracle. I’m not taking you to heaven. I\\'m telling you the source of all your problems is you, not somebody else .\", \\' Every life in this world is only trying to become a full-fledged life, whether it’s a worm or an insect or a bird or an animal or a tree, all they’re striving for is to become full-of-fledged . But we do not know what is a fully-fledged human being, even if I make you the king or queen of this planet tomorrow, still you will ask for the stars .\\', \" Sadhguru: What you accumulate can\\'t be yours. It can never, ever be you . Your entire involvement is with your physiology and psychology . Don’t expand it too much. It’s time it changes, that you experience the life that you are .\"]'"
